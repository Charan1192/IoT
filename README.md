**Usage**

Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script in Google Colab.
Run each code cell to execute the machine learning pipeline for each classifier.
**Decision Tree Classifier**

The Decision Tree Classifier is implemented using the scikit-learn library. The code includes a hyperparameter tuning step using GridSearchCV to optimize the model.

**K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier**

The K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier is implemented with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV. The code includes a pipeline with standard scaling and the KNeighborsClassifier.

**Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier**

The Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier is implemented using the scikit-learn library. The code includes hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and a pipeline with standard scaling.

**Random Forest Classifier**

The Random Forest Classifier implementation is added to the repository. It offers an ensemble approach to classification, enhancing the predictive performance.

**Data**
The dataset used for this project is available in the file 'clean.csv'. It includes features and a target variable for classification.
